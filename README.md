## About 
A collection of extension methods and utilities for implementing common data structures and algorithms
in Udon.

## Notice 
This module is still in development. A lot of data structures and algorithms are missing, not all test cases are covered, performance benchmarks are not available, and the API may change without notice. Also, I only add features when needed, so it may never be complete as a result. This is intended to be a starting point to build on rather than a complete solution.

## Installation 
1. In the Unity toolbar, select `Window` > `Package Manager` > `[+]` > `Add package from git URL...`.
2. Paste the following link: `https://github.com/zoebuffer/UDSA.git`.

## Examples 
See [samples](Samples~/) for usage examples.
